# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Project summary
The purpose of this project was to create an interactive map of earthquake data across the world for the last seven days.  The map can be displayed as reglar street view, satellite street view, or dark view.  There are options to view all earthquake data, tectonic plates, and major earthquake data individually or in combination with each other.

Earthquakes are represented on the map as circles whose diameter size and color relate directly to the magnitude of the earthquake. Clicking on a circle will display the magnitude of the selected earthquake as well as the location.
